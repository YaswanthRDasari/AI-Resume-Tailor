# Skills Extraction Improvements

## Overview
The skills extraction functionality has been significantly improved to properly identify and match skills between resumes and job descriptions.

## What Was Fixed

### Previous Issues
1. **Simple word splitting**: The old system used spaCy's `noun_chunks` which only extracted noun phrases, not actual skills
2. **Poor skill matching**: Skills like "Python" and "python" weren't being matched due to case sensitivity
3. **Limited skill recognition**: Only basic noun phrases were identified, missing technical skills, frameworks, tools, etc.

### New Implementation

#### 1. GPT-Powered Skills Extraction
- Uses OpenAI's GPT model to intelligently extract skills from text
- Focuses on specific categories:
  - Programming Languages (Python, Java, JavaScript, etc.)
  - Frameworks & Libraries (React, Django, TensorFlow, etc.)
  - Tools & Technologies (Docker, AWS, Git, etc.)
  - Databases (MySQL, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, etc.)
  - Frontend Technologies (HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, etc.)
  - Data Science & ML (TensorFlow, PyTorch, Pandas, etc.)
  - Soft Skills (Leadership, Communication, etc.)
  - Industry Skills (Machine Learning, Data Analysis, etc.)
  - Methodologies (Agile, Scrum, DevOps, etc.)

#### 2. Fallback Pattern Matching
- Comprehensive regex patterns for common technical skills
- Activated when GPT fails or returns insufficient results
- Covers 100+ common skills across different technology domains

#### 3. Smart Skill Normalization
- Case-insensitive matching for better skill comparison
- Removes duplicates while preserving original formatting
- Handles variations in skill naming

#### 4. Enhanced Resume Tailoring
- Uses extracted skills to guide the resume customization
- Emphasizes matched skills throughout the resume
- Creates skills sections highlighting relevant competencies

## Key Functions

### `extract_skills_with_gpt(text, context)`
- Primary skills extraction using GPT
- Context-aware (resume vs job description)
- Returns comma-separated list of skills

### `extract_basic_keywords(text)`
- Fallback pattern-based extraction
- Comprehensive regex patterns for technical skills
- Used when GPT is unavailable or insufficient

### `normalize_skills(skills)`
- Normalizes skill lists for better matching
- Removes duplicates and handles case sensitivity
- Preserves original formatting for display

## Testing

Run the test script to verify functionality:
```bash
cd backend
python test_skills_extraction.py
```

## Example Output

**Before (old system):**
```
Resume keywords: ['software engineer', 'years', 'experience', 'development']
Job keywords: ['python developer', 'experience', 'django', 'react']
```

**After (new system):**
```
Resume skills: ['Python', 'Django', 'Flask', 'React', 'AWS', 'Docker', 'Git', 'TensorFlow', 'Machine Learning', 'Leadership', 'Agile']
Job skills: ['Python', 'Django', 'React', 'AWS', 'Docker', 'Git', 'TensorFlow', 'PostgreSQL', 'MongoDB', 'Agile']
Matched skills: ['Python', 'Django', 'React', 'AWS', 'Docker', 'Git', 'TensorFlow', 'Agile']
Missing skills: ['PostgreSQL', 'MongoDB']
```

## Benefits

1. **Accurate Skill Identification**: Properly identifies technical skills, not just random words
2. **Better Matching**: Case-insensitive matching finds more relevant skill overlaps
3. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Handles 100+ common technical skills and frameworks
4. **Robust Fallback**: Works even when GPT is unavailable
5. **Enhanced Tailoring**: Uses skill analysis to guide resume customization
6. **Debugging Support**: Detailed logging for troubleshooting

## Configuration

The system automatically uses the best available method:
1. GPT-based extraction (primary)
2. Pattern matching fallback (if GPT fails)
3. Combined approach (if GPT returns insufficient results)

No additional configuration required - the system adapts automatically based on results quality.
