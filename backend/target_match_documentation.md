# Target Match Percentage Feature

## Overview

The Target Match Percentage feature allows job seekers to specify their desired match percentage (70%, 80%, 90%, or 100%) and automatically enhances their resume by intelligently adding missing skills to reach that target.

## How It Works

### 1. User Interface
- **Frontend**: Users can select a target match percentage from a dropdown (70%, 80%, 90%, 100%)
- **Optional**: If no target is selected, the system works as before
- **Clear Option**: Users can clear the selection to use original functionality

### 2. Backend Processing
- **Skill Analysis**: System identifies missing required and preferred skills
- **Target Calculation**: Calculates how many skills need to be added to reach the target percentage
- **Intelligent Addition**: Uses GPT to naturally integrate missing skills into the resume
- **Realistic Integration**: Ensures added skills sound authentic and believable

### 3. Smart Skill Prioritization
- **Required Skills First**: Prioritizes missing required skills over preferred skills
- **Realistic Assessment**: Only adds skills that would be realistic for the candidate
- **Natural Integration**: Phrases skills appropriately (e.g., "exposure to", "familiarity with")

## Key Functions

### `add_missing_skills_to_resume(resume_text, missing_skills, target_percentage)`
- Intelligently adds missing skills to reach target percentage
- Uses GPT to integrate skills naturally
- Maintains resume authenticity

### `calculate_skills_needed_for_target(target_percentage, current_skills, required_skills, preferred_skills)`
- Calculates which skills need to be added
- Prioritizes required skills over preferred skills
- Returns optimal skill list to reach target

### Enhanced `process_resume(resume_text, job_description, target_match_percentage)`
- Accepts optional target_match_percentage parameter
- Enhances resume if target > 0
- Returns both original and enhanced scores

## API Changes

### Backend Endpoint
```python
@app.post("/tailor")
def tailor_resume(
    resume_file: UploadFile = File(...),
    job_description: str = Form(...),
    target_match_percentage: int = Form(0)  # New parameter
):
```

### Frontend Integration
```javascript
const formData = new FormData();
formData.append('resume_file', resumeFile);
formData.append('job_description', jobDesc);
formData.append('target_match_percentage', targetMatchPercentage); // New field
```

## User Experience

### 1. Initial Analysis
- User uploads resume and job description
- System shows current match score and missing skills

### 2. Target Selection
- User selects desired match percentage (70%, 80%, 90%, 100%)
- System explains what will happen

### 3. Enhanced Results
- System shows both original and enhanced scores
- Displays which skills were added
- Provides realistic, tailored resume

## Example Workflow

### Before Enhancement
```
Current Match: 45%
Missing Required Skills: Django, React, AWS, Docker
Missing Preferred Skills: TensorFlow, Kubernetes
```

### After 80% Target Enhancement
```
Original Score: 45%
Enhanced Score: 82%
Skills Added: Django, React, AWS
Recommendation: Recommended
```

## Benefits

### For Job Seekers

## Technical Implementation

### Skill Integration Strategy
1. **Required Skills Priority**: Add missing required skills first
2. **Natural Language**: Use appropriate proficiency levels
3. **Context Integration**: Add skills to relevant sections

### Safety Measures
- **Sanity Checks**: Validate target percentages
- **Realistic Limits**: Don't add unrealistic skill combinations
- **Fallback**: Graceful handling of errors

## Testing

Run the test script to verify functionality:
```bash
cd AI-Resume-Tailor/backend
python test_target_match.py
```

This will test:
- Different target percentages (70%, 80%, 90%, 100%)
- Skill calculation accuracy
- Integration with existing functionality
- Error handling

## Future Enhancements

2. **Industry-Specific Templates**: Tailored skill sets by industry
3. **Learning Paths**: Suggest how to acquire missing skills
4. **Confidence Scores**: Show confidence in added skills
5. **Multiple Targets**: Try different targets simultaneously

### Advanced Features
1. **Skill Validation**: Verify added skills are realistic

## Usage Guidelines

### Best Practices
1. **Start Conservative**: Begin with 70-80% targets
