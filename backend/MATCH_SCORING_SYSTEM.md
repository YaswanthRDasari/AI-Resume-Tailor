# Match Scoring and Recommendation System

## Overview
The AI Resume Tailor now includes a comprehensive match scoring system that analyzes multiple parameters to provide intelligent application recommendations.

## Features

### üéØ **Multi-Parameter Analysis**
- **Skills Matching**: Compares required vs preferred skills with weighted scoring
- **Experience Analysis**: Evaluates years of experience against job requirements
- **Intelligence Assessment**: Uses GPT to extract and analyze job requirements
- **Gap Identification**: Identifies missing skills and experience gaps

### üìä **Scoring Algorithm**

#### Overall Score Calculation
```
Overall Score = (Skill Score √ó 0.6) + (Experience Score √ó 0.4)
```

#### Skill Score Breakdown
- **Required Skills**: 70% weight (critical for the role)
- **Preferred Skills**: 30% weight (nice to have)
- **Formula**: `(required_matches / total_required) √ó 0.7 + (preferred_matches / total_preferred) √ó 0.3`

#### Experience Score Calculation
- **Meets Requirements**: Base score of 0.8
- **Exceeds Requirements**: Bonus up to 0.2 for up to 50% more experience
- **Below Requirements**: Penalty proportional to the gap

### üèÜ **Recommendation Levels**

| Score Range | Level | Description | Color |
|-------------|-------|-------------|-------|
| 0.85+ | Strongly Recommended | Excellent match! High probability of success | Green |
| 0.70-0.84 | Recommended | Good match with most qualifications | Blue |
| 0.50-0.69 | Consider Applying | Moderate match, some gaps exist | Orange |
| 0.30-0.49 | Weak Match | Limited alignment, consider improving | Yellow |
| <0.30 | Not Recommended | Poor match, low probability | Red |

## Key Functions

### `calculate_match_score(resume_text, job_description, resume_skills, job_skills)`
**Purpose**: Main function that orchestrates the entire match analysis

**Returns**: Dictionary containing:
```python
{
    "overall_score": 0.85,                    # Overall match score (0-1)
    "skill_score": 0.90,                      # Skills match score (0-1)
    "experience_score": 0.78,                 # Experience match score (0-1)
    "skill_match_percentage": 90.0,           # Skills match percentage
    "experience_match_percentage": 78.0,      # Experience match percentage
    "recommendation_level": "Strongly Recommended",
    "recommendation_text": "Excellent match! This position aligns very well...",
    "color": "green",                         # UI color code
    "resume_years": 5,                        # Extracted years of experience
    "required_years": 3,                      # Required years from job
    "missing_required_skills": ["Kubernetes"], # Skills gaps
    "missing_preferred_skills": ["PyTorch"],
    "experience_level": "senior",             # Job experience level
    "industry": "tech"                        # Industry classification
}
```

### `extract_experience_years(text)`
**Purpose**: Uses GPT to extract total years of professional experience
**Returns**: Integer representing years of experience

### `extract_job_requirements(text)`
**Purpose**: Analyzes job description to extract structured requirements
**Returns**: Dictionary with required/preferred skills, experience, education, etc.

### `calculate_skill_match_score(resume_skills, job_skills, required_skills, preferred_skills)`
**Purpose**: Calculates weighted skill match score
**Returns**: Float between 0-1 representing skill alignment

### `calculate_experience_score(resume_years, required_years)`
**Purpose**: Evaluates experience match with bonus/penalty system
**Returns**: Float between 0-1 representing experience alignment

    "overall_score": 0.65,
    "skill_score": 0.70,
    "experience_score": 0.58,
    "skill_match_percentage": 70.0,
    "experience_match_percentage": 58.0,
    "recommendation_level": "Consider Applying",
    "recommendation_text": "Moderate match. Some gaps exist but worth applying.",
    "color": "orange",
